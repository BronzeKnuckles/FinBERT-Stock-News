# FinBERT-Stock-News



Link to Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/miguelaenlle/massive-stock-news-analysis-db-for-nlpbacktests

The idea is to use the dataset of stock news: headline, links, date, etc. to predict (or test) the prices movements of those stocks (increase or decrease or remain stable) based on sentiment score of the news using FinBert. 
> FinBert is an opensource pre trained Natural Language Processing (NLP) model, that has been specifically trained on Financial data, and outperforms almost all other NLP techniques for financial sentiment analysis.

Currently: Sentiment scored on news headlines *not news content* <br>
Next: Mine each stock news content with the given links > score the sentiments of news content.
